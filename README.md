# A Quantum-Elastic Spacetime Framework

This quantized elastic spacetime model, providing a definition of time based on the time-entropy mapping and demonstrating the mass-gravity duality mediated by the gauge symmetries of the Standard Model in quantum field theory.

This theoretical framework proposes a discrete quantum-elastic spacetime model that unifies entropy-driven time dynamics with fundamental interactions, bridging quantum field theory and general relativity. The core innovations include:

Time as Entropy-Driven Transformation. Time emerges from irreversible state transitions of discrete spacetime quanta (Space Elementary Quanta, SEQ), where each transition step corresponds to a computable multiplicative entropy derived from spatial transformation matrices. This provides a rigorous definition of time rooted in quantum thermodynamics.

Mass-Gravity Mechanism. Matter arises from SU(3)-mediated compression of SEQ networks, storing energy as mass while stretching surrounding space to generate gravity. The Higgs field acts as a quantum stabilizer to maintain coherence in compressed regions, explaining both quark confinement and gravitational effects.
